    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. It involves fetching web pages and extracting information from the HTML code. Web scraping is used to automate the extraction of data that might be time-consuming or challenging to obtain manually. Here are three areas where web scraping is commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Mining and Analysis: Web scraping is often used to collect data for analysis and research purposes. For example, extracting financial data, market trends, or sentiment analysis from various websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive Intelligence: Companies use web scraping to gather information about competitors, such as product details, pricing, and customer reviews. This helps businesses make informed decisions and stay competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content Aggregation: News aggregators and content websites use web scraping to gather articles and information from various sources, providing users with a centralized location for accessing diverse content.\n"

    "\"\"\"Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various methods for web scraping, and the choice of method depends on the complexity of the task. Common methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Copy-Pasting: Simple but time-consuming, where data is copied from a website and pasted into a local file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Regex): Parsing HTML with regex to extract specific patterns. It's effective for simple tasks but can be fragile for complex HTML structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Parsing Libraries: Using libraries like Beautiful Soup (Python), Nokogiri (Ruby), or Jsoup (Java) to parse HTML and extract desired information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headless Browsers: Utilizing browser automation tools like Selenium to load web pages in a headless browser and interact with the DOM to extract information.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to access their data in a structured way, avoiding the need for scraping.\"\"\""

    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. Beautiful Soup is widely used for web scraping due to its simplicity and flexibility. It helps navigate and search the parse tree, making it easy to extract specific data from HTML documents."

In a web scraping project, Flask might be used to create a simple web interface to display the scraped data. Flask allows developers to create web applications quickly and easily, making it a suitable choice for presenting the scraped data in a user-friendly manner."
