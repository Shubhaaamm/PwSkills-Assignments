    "Q-1: What is Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception:\n",
    "          In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts\n",
    "          the normal flow of instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception,\n",
    "          which is an object containing information about the error. Exceptions can occur due to a variety\n",
    "          of reasons, such as invalid operations, unexpected input, or resource exhaustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Exceptions are errors that occur during the runtime execution of a program, often due to unexpected \n",
    "       conditions or situations.\n",
    "Cause: They are typically caused by logical errors, invalid input, improper usage of functions, division by zero,\n",
    "       accessing undefined variables, etc.\n",
    "Detection: Exceptions are detected during the runtime when the problematic code is executed.\n",
    "Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks. This allows the program to gracefully handle\n",
    "         errors and continue executing, or perform specific actions based on the type of exception.\n",
    "Example: Common types of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, ValueError, IndexError, FileNotFoundError, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Syntax errors are mistakes in the code structure that violate the rules of the programming language.\n",
    "      They occur during the parsing of the code before the program's execution begins.\n",
    "Cause: They are caused by incorrect syntax, such as missing colons, mismatched parentheses, invalid identifiers, or \n",
    "      improper indentation.\n",
    "Detection: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase before the program starts\n",
    "     running.\n",
    "Handling: Syntax errors cannot be caught or handled using try-except blocks. They must be fixed by correcting the \n",
    "     code's syntax.\n",
    "Example: Examples of syntax errors include missing parentheses, using an undefined variable, missing indentation, etc."
